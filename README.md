# Trader-Test

##### This is a sample mental maths assessment similar to those given by many trading firms and market makers in their application process. It is structured similar to the Flow Traders assessment. Round 1 contains 30 'easy' problems, Round 2 consists of 30 decimal problems and Round 3 has 15 difficult multiplication problems. You should be aiming to score at least 60-70% in 10 minutes to satisfy the requirements of most trading firms.

##### To run the test simply download and run the python file. You have the option to test yourself on each of the rounds separately or to take the entire test at once. At the end you will receive your score and the time taken.
